    "So this code adds indexes to both dropdown lists and carents for cancer patients in the dicom files and astericks for cancer patients in the LUNA16 dropdown list.  I will also be committing a little more code to circle the malignant nodules in the LUNA16 data set, and will likely display the slice number where the malignant tumors are located.  The real-world x, y, and z coordinates along with the diameter (all measured in mm) of the malignant cells are found in the annotations csv file included in the LUNA16 data collection.  Feel free to commit any changes that makes this image viewer faster.  \n",
    "\n",
    "An important note about the annotations.csv is that the coordinates and diameter in this file are in millimeters (I'm pretty sure) and need to be converted into voxel (3D pixels) spacing depending on the spacing of each LUNA16 patients CT scan calibration so we can circle the nodule.  I'll be adding comments in the code, but it's important to keep the structure of the image array, and the structure of sitk.GetOrigin() and sitk.GetSpacing() lists in check so we're dividing and subtracting correctly.  It will all make sense in my comments, but it was frustrating to find hard documentation on how numpy arrays, and SimpleITK, ordered pixels/the ct origin/the ct scan spacing lists:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Numpy arrays of the CT scan have the shape displayed as [z,y,x].\n",
    "* GetOrigin() command displays (x, y, z), which is the voxel origin of the CT scan.  \n",
    "* GetSpacing() command displayes either (x, y, z) or (y, x, z), I'm not sure which, but I ran a loop and x was always equalled y in a small subset of the data, so I guess the order doesn't matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anyway, make commits as you need to and let's try and speed this code up a little bit, if possible. One thing that irks me is how the CT scans flash whenever a new scan is selected in the image slider; it would be great if we could somehow find a way to make the images fade in and out so it's less choppy.  Good hunting!\n",
